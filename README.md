Mario Sulé Domínguez - FE Coding Task for Sportradar


1. Overview 

This project is the FrontEnd coding task for my application of the Vienna Coding Academy Program 2026.

It has been built using React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. The project is basically a sport's event dynamic calendar where users can view, filter, and manage sporting events by adding new ones or deleting others.

The calendar is displayed highlighting event dates, and lets users add new events through a form, or delete previous ones clicking on the date of the event to see its details. 

Different hooks or React are used (useNavigate, useState, useReducer, useEffect), and all events users have registered are persisted using localStorage, while initial data is loaded from a JSON file. The app has been developed using a responsive design and ensuring navigation is accessible from all pages.




2. Instruccions on how to run the App

You can try my application online using Netlify at https://sportiva-mariosule.netlify.app/ . Netlify is a cloud platform that automatically builds and hosts web applications from your project's code repository. It provides a fast and global deployment of applications.

You can also run it locally by downloading the .zip project, and extracting its content. Then you should open the main project folder in a development environment such as Visual Studio Code. Install dependencies by running 'npm install' on a terminal, and then start the development server with 'npm run dev'. It will show the local URL that you can copy paste into a browser to run the app.

All the code of the project is allocated on my GitHub: https://github.com/mariosulee/Sportiva-FE-CodingTask.git
