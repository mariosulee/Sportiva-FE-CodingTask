All the code implemented in this project has been written and supervised by me.
I understand all parts of it and have used my own work methods, logic, and programming
practices that I have learned during my studies and perfected them.

Regarding the parts where AI was used, I primarily relied on it for translating the 
extended documentation that I have written in Spanish. I have used it because that document
was not necessary for the submission and I wrote it as I wanted to explain in more detail
how I built and implemented everything.

I have also used AI to assist with the typing of the event object to automate and speed up
the creation of example events in my JSON file. This helped reduce repetitive manual work while also
making sure the data structures are correct. When doing this kind of manual unnecessary work, it 
is common to make mistakes, so I think it is useful to use AI only in these cases.

Lastly, AI was helpful when guiding some technical decisions, such as evaluating the most efficient
way to implement state management. AI provided me with different alternatives, but I implemented the states
and methodologies myself, following these guidelines.

All logic and functionality were completed and verified by me to ensure correctness and understanding.

One potential improvement I would make to the application, given more time, would be to integrate Context API 
along with a custom hook for managing global state more efficiently. This would allow components like Calendar, 
EventDetail, and EventForm to access and update events seamlessly without passing props manually.
